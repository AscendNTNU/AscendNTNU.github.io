          Our first aerial robot was born last fall. Creating it, flying it and using it has been a great learning experience for the team. The drone is however quite small, and we needed an upgrade in order to carry all the desired equipment.

          Our second aerial robot is custom designed using carbon fiber and 3D-printed parts. It was build for the 2016 IARC and designed with Mission 7 in mind, and it is able to carry all the equipment we need to herd the target robots across the green line.

        <p>
          The <strong>sensors</strong> it has for navigation, ground robot detection and collision avoidance is five cameras, one laser rangefinder, one 2D laser scanner, and an inertial measurement unit.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <strong>data processing</strong> is done using an on-board Intel NUC, in addition to an external computer communicating using WiFi. The flight controller is a Pixhawk connected to the NUC.

        <p>
          Our <strong>software</strong> can recognize the lines and corners of the grid, detect target robots and decide when and how to interact with them.
