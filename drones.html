          Our first aerial robot was born last fall. Creating it, flying it and using it has been a great learning experience for the team. The drone is however quite small, and we needed an upgrade in order to carry all the desired equipment.

          Our primary aerial robot is a custom designed carbon fiber drone with several improvements compared to our first drone. It is designed with IARC Mission 7 in mind, and should be able to carry all the equipment we need to heard the target robots across the green line. The picture above is from an early flight. The drone is going to look a lot better when it is finished.

          The <strong>sensors</strong> we will use are five cameras, one laser proximity sensor, one 2d laser scanner, and an inertial measurement unit.

          The <strong>data processing</strong> is done using an on-board Intel NUC, in addition to an external computer communicating using WiFi. The flight controller is a Pixhawk connected to the NUC.

          Our <strong>software</strong> can recognize the lines and corners of the grid, detect target robots and decide when and how to interact with them.
