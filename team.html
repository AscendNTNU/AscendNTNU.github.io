				<h1>The team</h1>
				<p>
					We have four groups: AI, Control, Perception and Admin. The board consists of the project manager, the deputy project manager, the technical leader and the group leaders. This means that we formally have a quite hierarchical stucture. However, in practice we have a very flat structure where everybody contributes within the areas they want and where attention is needed.
