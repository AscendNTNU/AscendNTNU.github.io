A github pages test - in early stages of development. It is based on the standard jekyll template, but with bootrap added. Styling currently borrowed from the bootstrap-zero Pratt template.

#To test locally.
1. Install jekyll following the [github pages guide][gh-pages-jekyll-guide].
2. Use command `bundle exec jekyll serve` when in the project root.

#To continue developing:
1. Install client side dependencies using Bower
2. Add dependencies to js folder using grunt
