A github pages test - in early stages of development. It is based on the standard jekyll template, but with bootrap added. Styling currently borrowed from the bootstrap-zero Pratt template. Gulp used as build system.

##To test locally
1. Install jekyll following the [github pages guide][gh-pages-jekyll-guide].
2. Install server side dev dependencies using `npm install`
3. Install client side dependencies using `bower install`
4. Start server using `gulp` when in the project root.

You need nodejs and the npm packages less, gulp, BrowserSync and bower to do this.
