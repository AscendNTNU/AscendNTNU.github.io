## The goals of the International Aerial Robotics Competition
The primary purpose of the international aerial robotics competition is to move the state-of-the-art aerial robotics forward through the creation of significant and useful mission challenges that are impossible at the time they are proposed. The idea is that when the behaviours called for in the mission eventually are demonstrated in the competition, the technology will have been advanced for the benefit of the world.

## Mission 7

### The background
Mission seven calls for three new behaviours that have never been attempted in any of the past six missions.

1. **Interaction between aerial robots and moving objects:** The drones must be able to track and physicallty interact with randomly moving ground objects. This behavior has application to the use of aerial robots from moving platforms such as ships, trucks, or even other air vehicles.

2. **Navigation in a sterile environment:** The drones must be able to navigate in a sterile environment with no external navigation aids such as GPS or large stationary points of reference such as walls. Many of the same missions that have been flown with these navigation aids in the past 6 missions could have been conducted by a trained animal or human without the use of GPS or SLAM. So why should our aerial robots be dependent on these external navigation aids, especially when working in a confined space? The competition calls for a navigation method which resembles that of living organisms. 

3. **Interaction between competing autonomus air vehicles:** Reliable interaction between unmanned aerial systems and manned or unmanned aircraft is an essential capability that is necessary before civil aviation authorities will allow unmanned aerial vehicles to operate in manned airspace for civilian applications. The requirement is referred to as “sense and avoid”. Air vehicles must be able to sense the presence of fixed and moving obstacles to avoid collision. Presently, the stateof-the-art in sense and avoid technology for unmanned aerial vehicles is in its infancy, and has never been reliably demonstrated in a fully autonomous aerial robot. This aerial robotic behavior, once demonstrated, rates very high on the state-of-the-art importance scale. To solve mission 7, the teams must implement some form of "sense and avoild"-technique.
